# Youtrip Statement Extraction
 Using a Python script, this tool efficiently converts PDF statements into a CSV file format.

 # Why did i write this script?
 I have a slight obsession with retrospectively tracking my finances - my initial credit card statement project was the catalyst to my curiousity [see more here](https://github.com/jameskohjunwei/monthly-finance-automation). This script is a follow up to that system.

 I also wanted to deep dive into the pdfplumber package and documentation. 

 Lastly, i love projects that is in the spirit of ["automating the boring stuff with python"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).

 # How to use
 1. In your ide, `pip3 install youtrip_statement_extraction_requirement.txt`
 2. Import the sample file into your environment.
 3. Change the path of the pdf to your sample file path.
 4. Run the script to make sure your environment works before you make modifications to fit your need.
